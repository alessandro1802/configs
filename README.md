# Fedora configs

# Set-up

Clone the repository wherever you want (`~/Documents` is recommended).
```bash
cd configs
./install.sh
```
Reboot for the changes to take effect.

The code above installs several applications, makes symbolic links to configs and *zsh* as default shell.

# Vim

`vimx` aka `vim` with enhancements (see [Vim - Fedora Project Wiki](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Vim))

# zsh

 `zsh` shell and [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

# tmux


# Scripts

```
~/.bin/
```
